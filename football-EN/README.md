# Football projects

This folder serves as a unique storage of projects related to football, with the intention of exploring the infinite possibilities that this sport offers for the field of data analysis. For me, these football-related projects are a way to mix a hobby with data analysis, making the whole process more engaging and enjoyable. It is worth mentioning that these specific projects, involving football, have a mostly personal purpose, serving as a way of monitoring my own evolution in the area.

Feel free to explore the details of each project and the results obtained. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to get in touch. You can find me on LinkedIn for more information about my career and experience. I am very interested in data analysis, performance analysis and visualization projects in general applied to football. I am available both to answer questions and to collaborate on projects related to these areas.

## [Evaluation of a simple predictive model for football](https://github.com/hmantovani/hmantovani/tree/main/football-EN/football-predicting-model)

In this project, we developed a prediction model for football matches. The model was applied in 9 editions of the Brazilian Championship (from 2014 to 2022). We use the first round (matchdays 1-19) as model training and the second round (matchdays 20-38) as testing. During the process, we simulated the second round matches, calculated the final classification (1st real round + 2nd simulated round) and compared the results obtained with reality. The objective is to analyze whether it is possible to make reliable predictions using a small base.

## [Brazilian 2023 Prediction](https://github.com/hmantovani/hmantovani/tree/main/football-EN/prediction-brasileirao-2023)

In this second project, our attention turns to the 2023 Brasileir√£o. We used data from all editions of the Brazilian Championship since 2014 as a training set, in addition to the 1st round of that year. We then apply the model to simulate the second round, with the aim of predicting the final table. At the time of writing this text, the 2023 edition had not yet been completed, therefore, it is not possible to make comparisons with actual results. Note that this model is already a little more robust, as it contains results from 19 shifts as the training basis, instead of the single shift from the previous project.
