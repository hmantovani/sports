Football, deeply rooted in Brazilian culture as a national passion, transcends geographical and social boundaries, uniting fans of all ages in a sports spectacle. Brazil lives and breathes football. The sport intertwines with the daily lives of millions of Brazilians.

A sport with such anticipation and passion will always stir up excitement for the next match, sharpening creativity and leading some to envision the game in their imagination. In this scenario, the prediction of football championships emerges as an intriguing and innovative tool for sports enthusiasts. By employing algorithms and historical data, these models offer an alternative view of how tournaments could unfold.

Simulating football championships is not just a simple projection of results; it is an exploration of the realm of possibilities. Iconic moments can be relived, such as Brazil's World Cup victories, or hypothetical scenarios can be created, such as clashes between legends of the past and current stars. It is also a tool for alternative history: the famous "What if...?" can take shape through result modeling, providing a parallel world of championships and titles. Furthermore, these models also offer a valuable opportunity for statistical analysis, strategy development, and an enhanced understanding of the game at its core.

Before we delve into the analysis of the results, it is important to understand why we chose the Brazilian Championship as the subject of our study. The tournament has been the stage for a series of exciting and remarkable developments. Let's explore some of these facts that make the Brazilian Championship a fitting choice for our analysis.

**Expanding Financial Power:** For at least the last 30 years, Brazilian football has been distancing itself financially from European football, leading clubs to be prone to losing their stars in the middle of the season. However, this scenario has been changing due to an increasing injection of private money into the competitions. Several clubs have chosen to become corporations, attracting investment from millionaires around the world. In the Brasileirão alone, we have 6 examples:

* Bahia (City Group, the largest football conglomerate)
* Botafogo (John Textor, who manages clubs like Lyon and Crystal Palace)
* Cruzeiro (Ronaldo Fenômeno, a great idol and academy graduate)
* Cuiabá (a pioneer in Brazil: a corporation since its foundation, and its management model has been attracting attention)
* Red Bull Bragantino (Red Bull, owner of clubs in Germany, Austria, Ghana and the United States)
* Vasco (777, owners of Hertha Berlin, Genoa, and Sevilla)

**Growing Continental Dominance:** Brazilian clubs have become increasingly unbeatable outside the country. In 2022, of the 8 semifinalists in the Copa Libertadores and Copa Sudamericana, 5 were Brazilian. Finals and semifinals between Brazilian clubs are becoming more common, expanding the clashes beyond the horizon of the Brazilian Championship.

**Renowned Players:** The attraction of renowned players who have already built successful careers in Europe and other parts of the world to play in the Brazilian Championship has become a strong trend. This presence of standout players contributes to raising the level of competition, bringing a unique mix of talent and experience to Brazilian fields. This year's edition, in particular, features the highest number of high-caliber players we have ever seen.

* Athletico - Fernandinho and Arturo Vidal
* Atlético-MG - Hulk
* Botafogo - Tiquinho Soares and Diego Costa
* Corinthians - Lucas Veríssimo
* Coritiba - Islam Slimani and Jesé Rodríguez
* Flamengo - David Luiz and Filipe Luís
* Fluminense - Marcelo
* Grêmio - Luis Suárez and João Pedro
* Internacional - Enner Valencia, Hugo Mallo
* São Paulo - James Rodríguez and Lucas Moura
* Vasco - Dimitri Payet and Gary Medel

**Competitive and Unpredictable League:** The Brazilian Championship is notoriously known for its high competitiveness, considered one of the most contested leagues in the world. The season is characterized by a diversity of clubs that start the race dreaming of the title, but also by the fierce battle for every position in the table. Each match becomes a box of surprises and twists, making predictions more challenging.

It is important to note that every prediction model may perform better in contexts like the major European leagues, including England, Italy, Germany, Spain, and France. In these leagues, the difference in technical level between teams is clearer, and fewer clubs start the tournament with realistic title chances. This scenario may provide a conducive environment for the model to achieve higher accuracy. However, in the unique and unpredictable context of the Brazilian Championship, with its wide range of clubs and possible scenarios, our analysis focuses on understanding how our model adapts and behaves in an environment where competition is a true challenge.
