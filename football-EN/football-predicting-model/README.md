Football, rooted in Brazilian culture as a national passion, transcends geographic and social borders, uniting fans of all ages in a sporting spectacle. Brazil breathes football. From the potholed streets of favelas to the impeccable lawns of world-famous stadiums, sport is intertwined with the everyday lives of millions of Brazilians. Regional rivalries fuel fans' passion and lend authenticity and intensity to each match.

A sport with such expectation and passion will always provoke anxiety for the next match in fans, sharpening creativity and causing some to project the game in their imagination. On the internet, there are many
programs classified as "simulators", but which only function as an automatic table. You enter the results of each game and view the table. In this scenario, football championship predictions emerge as an intriguing and innovative tool for those passionate about the sport. By employing algorithms and historical data, these models offer an alternative view on how tournaments could play out.

The simulation of football championships is not just a simple projection of results; it is a foray into the realm of possibilities. You can relive iconic moments, such as the Brazilian team's World Cup victories, or create hypothetical scenarios, such as clashes between past legends and current stars. It's also an alternative history tool: the famous "What if...?" can take shape through results modeling, providing a parallel world of championships and titles. Furthermore, these models also provide a valuable opportunity for statistical analysis, strategy development, and improving understanding of the game at its core. A common use of statistical modeling focused on football is sports betting. Both bookmakers - looking for quotes that give them a profit margin - and bettors - looking to find quotes that overcome the risks - end up turning to methods like this.

In a country where football transcends the sporting sphere and becomes an intrinsic part of cultural identity, simulated football championships offer a new angle for expressing this passion. It unites technical knowledge with imagination, allowing enthusiasts to explore alternative scenarios, relive past glories and anticipate the future with a healthy dose of excitement and curiosity. The journey that begins now is an in-depth analysis of an extremely simple model for predicting results: the model does not require anything other than the score and date of the game. For the fun purposes mentioned above, it is an easy way to model a team's offensive and defensive capacity and carry out simulations. For professional purposes, such as sports betting, a more complex model would be needed.

For comparison purposes, the same model will be applied to 9 editions of the Brazilian Championship, starting in 2014 and ending in 2022. The 2023 edition will receive special attention, with predictions that will only be confirmed or rejected in December. Each year, the model will use all first round games as training to calculate offensive and defensive levels for each team and simulate second round games. In short, it's as if we went back to the end of the first round each year and tried to predict the end of that championship with the data we had available at that time. The model uses the offensive and defensive levels of each team, in addition to the field command, to calculate the probability of each score (0x0, 1x0, 0x1, 1x1...) for each game. The sample function and its prob argument are responsible for "choosing" a result for each match. At the end of the championship, the classification table is set up. We repeat this process 1000 times for each year and calculate the average of all tables. This average of the 1000 simulations is then considered the "simulated rating" and will be compared to the actual rating for that year.
